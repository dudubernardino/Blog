Creating muscle memory of the basic processes of development — it seems to me — is the surest and fastest way to reach a place of creative ability. The boring and monotonous is a pre-requisite to the exciting, improvisation of creative development. That’s why I’m sitting here about to dive into a tutorial I’ve already completed. It’s time to tackle this tutorial a second time and really nail it in. 
This tutorial is based on Udemy’s The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course.
